# JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations.

## var
Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

## let
Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.

## const
Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.

# Variable scope
A variable may belong to one of the following scopes:

Global scope: The default scope for all code running in script mode.
Module scope: The scope for code running in module mode.
Function scope: The scope created with a function.
