## Data types
The latest ECMAScript standard defines eight data types:

Seven data types that are primitives:
## Boolean. true and false.
## null. A special keyword denoting a null value. (Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.)
## undefined. A top-level property whose value is not defined.
## Number. An integer or floating point number. For example: 42 or 3.14159.
## BigInt. An integer with arbitrary precision. For example: 9007199254740992n.
## String. A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example: "Howdy".
## Symbol. A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.
## and Object
### Although these data types are relatively few, they enable you to perform useful operations with your applications. Functions are the other fundamental elements of the language. While functions are technically a kind of object, you can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your script can perform.
